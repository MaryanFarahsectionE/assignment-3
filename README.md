i made this one piece quiz using html, css, and javascript. html was for setting up the questions and answers, css made it look nice and showed if answers were right or wrong by changing colors, and javascript made the quiz work like moving to the next question and keeping score. i ran into a few tricky parts like figuring out how to tell you right away if you got the answer right without letting you change your answer, making sure the quiz worked well on both phones and computers.
